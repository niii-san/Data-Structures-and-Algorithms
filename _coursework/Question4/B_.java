 * Question 4 (B)
You have a map of a city represented by a graph with n nodes (representing locations) and edges where
edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates a road between locations ai and bi. Each location has a value of either 0 or 1,
indicating whether there is a package to be delivered. You can start at any location and perform the
following actions:
Collect packages from all locations within a distance of 2 from your current location.
Move to an adjacent location.
Your goal is to collect all packages and return to your starting location.
Goal:
Determine the minimum number of roads you need to traverse to collect all packages.
Input:
packages: An array of package values for each location.
roads: A 2D array representing the connections between locations.
Output:
The minimum number of roads to traverse.
Note that if you pass a roads several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.
Input: packages = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], roads = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
Output:2
Explanation: Start at location 2, collect the packages at location 0, move to location 3, collect the
packages at location 5 then move back to location 2.
Input: packages = [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], roads = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Start at location 0, collect the package at location 4 and 3, move to location 2, collect the
package at location 7, then move back to location 0.

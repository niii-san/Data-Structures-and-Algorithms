/*
 * Question 6 (B)
Scenario: A Multithreaded Web Crawler
Problem:
You need to crawl a large number of web pages to gather data or index content. Crawling each page
sequentially can be time-consuming and inefficient.
Goal:
Create a web crawler application that can crawl multiple web pages concurrently using multithreading to
improve performance.
Tasks:
Design the application:
Create a data structure to store the URLs to be crawled.
Implement a mechanism to fetch web pages asynchronously.
Design a data storage mechanism to save the crawled data.
Create a thread pool:
Use the ExecutorService class to create a thread pool for managing multiple threads.
Submit tasks:
For each URL to be crawled, create a task (e.g., a Runnable or Callable object) that fetches the web page
and processes the content.
Submit these tasks to the thread pool for execution.
Handle responses:
Process the fetched web pages, extracting relevant data or indexing the content.
Handle errors or exceptions that may occur during the crawling process.
Manage the crawling queue:
Implement a mechanism to manage the queue of URLs to be crawled, such as a priority queue or a
breadth-first search algorithm.
By completing these tasks, you will create a multithreaded web crawler that can efficiently crawl large
numbers of web page

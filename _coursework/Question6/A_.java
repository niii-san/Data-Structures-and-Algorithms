/*
 * Question 6 (A)
a)
You are given a class NumberPrinter with three methods: printZero, printEven, and printOdd.
These methods are designed to print the numbers 0, even numbers, and odd numbers, respectively.
Task:
Create a ThreadController class that coordinates three threads:
5. ZeroThread: Calls printZero to print 0s.
6. EvenThread: Calls printEven to print even numbers.
7. OddThread: Calls printOdd to print odd numbers.
These threads should work together to print the sequence "0102030405..." up to a specified number n.
The output should be interleaved, ensuring that the numbers are printed in the correct order.
Example:
If n = 5, the output should be "0102030405".
Constraints:
 The threads should be synchronized to prevent race conditions and ensure correct output.
 The NumberPrinter class is already provided and cannot be modified.

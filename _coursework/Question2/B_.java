/*
 * Question 2 (B)
You have two points in a 2D plane, represented by the arrays x_coords and y_coords. The goal is to find
the lexicographically pair i.e. (i, j) of points (one from each array) that are closest to each other.

Goal:
Determine the lexicographically pair of points with the smallest distance and smallest distance calculated
using
| x_coords [i] - x_coords [j]| + | y_coords [i] - y_coords [j]|

Note that
|x| denotes the absolute value of x.
A pair of indices (i1, j1) is lexicographically smaller than (i2, j2) if i1 < i2 or i1 == i2 and j1 < j2.

Input:
x_coords: The array of x-coordinates of the points.
y_coords: The array of y-coordinates of the points.
Output:
The indices of the closest pair of points.

Input: x_coords = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], y_coords = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [0, 3]

Explanation: Consider index 0 and index 3. The value of | x_coords [i]- x_coords [j]| + | y_coords [i]-
y_coords [j]| is 1, which is the smallest value we can achieve.

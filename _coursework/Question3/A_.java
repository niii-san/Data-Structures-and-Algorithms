 * Question 3 (A)
You have a network of n devices. Each device can have its own communication module installed at a
cost of modules [i - 1]. Alternatively, devices can communicate with each other using direct connections.

The cost of connecting two devices is given by the array connections where each connections[j] =
[device1j, device2j, costj] represents the cost to connect devices device1j and device2j. Connections are
bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two devices with different
costs.

Goal:
Determine the minimum total cost to connect all devices in the network.

Input:
n: The number of devices.
modules: An array of costs to install communication modules on each device.
connections: An array of connections, where each connection is represented as a triplet [device1j,
device2j, costj].
Output:
The minimum total cost to connect all devices.

Example:
Input: n = 3, modules = [1, 2, 2], connections = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1]] Output: 3
Explanation:
The best strategy is to install a communication module on the first device with cost 1 and connect the
other devices to it with cost 2, resulting in a total cost of 3

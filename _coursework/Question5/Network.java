 * Question 5
Optimizing a Network with Multiple Objectives
Problem:
Suppose you are hired as software developer for certain organization and you are tasked with creating a
GUI application that helps network administrators design a network topology that is both cost-effective
and efficient for data transmission. The application needs to visually represent servers and clients as
nodes in a graph, with potential network connections between them, each having associated costs and
bandwidths. The goal is to enable the user to find a network topology that minimizes both the total cost
and the latency of data transmission.
Approach:
1. Visual Representation of the Network:
o Design the GUI to allow users to create and visualize a network graph where each node
represents a server or client, and each edge represents a potential network connection. The
edges should display associated costs and bandwidths.
2. Interactive Optimization:
o Implement tools within the GUI that enable users to apply algorithms or heuristics to
optimize the network. The application should provide options to find the best combination
of connections that minimizes the total cost while ensuring all nodes are connected.
3. Dynamic Path Calculation:
o Include a feature where the user can calculate the shortest path between any pair of nodes
within the selected network topology. The GUI should display these paths, taking into
account the bandwidths as weights.
4. Real-time Evaluation:
o Provide real-time analysis within the GUI that displays the total cost and latency of the
current network topology. If the user is not satisfied with the results, they should be able
to adjust the topology and explore alternative solutions interactively.
Example:
 Input: The user inputs a graph in the application, representing servers, clients, potential
connections, their costs, and bandwidths.
 Output: The application displays the optimal network topology that balances cost and latency,
and shows the shortest paths between servers and clients on the GUI.
